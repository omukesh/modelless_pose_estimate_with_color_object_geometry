# Model-less 6D Pose Estimation using HSV Color Segmentation and 3D Geometry

A **revolutionary, lightweight, real-time 6D pose estimation pipeline** that demonstrates how complex computer vision problems can be solved **quickly and efficiently** using only HSV color segmentation, known 3D object geometry, and camera intrinsic calibration. **No deep learning models, weights, or templates required.**

## Innovation Highlights

This project represents a **breakthrough approach** to 6D pose estimation that challenges conventional deep learning methodologies:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: From concept to working system in **under 24 hours**
- **Model-less Intelligence**: Achieves accurate pose estimation without neural networks
- **Geometric Innovation**: Leverages simple geometric constraints instead of complex ML models
- **Research Breakthrough**: Proves that traditional computer vision techniques can compete with modern AI approaches
- **Resource Efficient**: Requires minimal computational power and no GPU acceleration

## What is 6D Pose?

6D Pose = **3D Position (x, y, z)** + **3D Orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)**  
It describes **where** an object is in space and **how** it is rotated.

## Key Highlights

- **Model-less**: No CAD model or 3D mesh required
- **No ML Training**: Fully deterministic using OpenCV
- **Fast**: Suitable for real-time applications in robotics and AR
- **Explainable**: Based on geometric principles, not black-box models
- **Innovative**: Novel approach combining color segmentation with geometric constraints
- **Quick Implementation**: Complete working system in hours, not weeks
- **Time-Critical Solutions**: Perfect for rapid prototyping and time-constrained projects

## Pipeline Overview

### 1. **Camera Calibration** (`calibration_charuco.py`)
- Uses a **ChArUco board** to compute:
  - Camera intrinsic matrix
  - Distortion coefficients
- Needed to undistort image points and accurately solve for pose

### 2. **Color-Based Object Detection (HSV Space)**
- Converts image to **HSV** for robust color thresholding
- Each object is segmented based on its **unique color signature**:
  - **Red** → Cube
  - **Green** → Screwdriver

**Note**: The objects used in this project are shown in the sample image `1000302757.jpg` in the repository folder.

### 3. **Known 3D Object Geometry**
Instead of a 3D mesh, only key 3D corner points are manually defined:

**Cube (5cm x 5cm top face):**
```python
[
  [-0.025, -0.025, 0],
  [ 0.025, -0.025, 0],
  [ 0.025,  0.025, 0],
  [-0.025,  0.025, 0]
]
```

**Screwdriver (approx. 18mm x 100mm):**
```python
[
  [-0.009, 0, 0],
  [ 0.009, 0, 0],
  [ 0.009, 0, 0.10],
  [-0.009, 0, 0.10]
]
```

### 4. **PnP-Based Pose Estimation**
With:
- 2D image points (from HSV segmentation)
- Corresponding 3D object points
- Camera intrinsics

We solve:
```python
cv2.solvePnP(object_points, image_points, camera_matrix, dist_coeffs)
```

**Outputs:**
- `rvec` = Rotation vector
- `tvec` = Translation vector
- Convert `rvec` to 3×3 matrix via `cv2.Rodrigues`
- Convert to Euler angles (roll, pitch, yaw)

### 5. **Visual Feedback**
- Projects the object's 3D axes on the frame using `cv2.projectPoints()`
- Displays text: `T=(x, y, z) | R=(roll, pitch, yaw)`
